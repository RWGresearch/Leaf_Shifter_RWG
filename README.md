# Leaf_Shifter_RWG
This code is to add paddle shifters from a R56 mini cooper rewired through the clock spring using 2 pins for analog input to control the shifter on a Nissan Leaf all years up to 2025?

If you want to know the hardware, I used:

R56 Mini Cooper Paddle Shifter. look on Ebay there everywhere, nice paddle shifters too! There push and pull! Feel SOLID too. I may need to mount them to the wheel its self at some point but for now there fine mounted on the plastic cover... 

( because i had this isolator, but any isolator will work if you add pull up resistors on the data lines... ..) https://atlas-scientific.com/ezo-accessories/basic-ezo-inline-voltage-isolator

ESP32-C3 super mini but most ESP / Arduino's will work: https://www.sudo.is/docs/esphome/boards/esp32c3supermini/

GPIO extender: PCF8574 https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCF8574_PCF8574A.pdf

that's it... Basic stuff... because i can...
